Code and design for the TEC Speech board that uses the SP0256A-AL2 chip.  This chip is hard to find now and there are many fakes out there so ensure you have an original.  Some fakes are actually the SP0256-012 (Mattel Chip) and some crash the system.  I've include a picture of the original chip.  You can get them from http://www.sciencestore.co.uk/acatalog/Electronics.html

I've include TEC code and a program writting in RUBY that will output data for the SP0256A-AL2 given any text.  Hex Data is just in text but I will someday output it in Binary for easy transferral to the TEC.
